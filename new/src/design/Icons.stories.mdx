# Icons

To ensure a consistent UI we will try to use as few different UI icon providers as possible.

## Lucide

[Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) is the main Icon set we should always use be default.

## Radix Icons

In some cases, the Lucide icons are to big and heavy. Like for example a small arror for a select box. In this cases we go with [Radix Icons](https://icons.radix-ui.com/) (currently provided via `react-icons/rx`)
