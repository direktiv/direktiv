# Validate State Form

One of the qualities of life features that the direktiv-ui adds is that when executing a workflow through the UI and the first state of that workflow is a validate state; A form will be generated to prompt users for the input.

If we take a look at the workflow below we can see that the first state is a validate state that requires the string property `name`.

```yaml
states:
  - id: validate-input
    type: validate
    schema:
      type: object
      required:
        - name
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
          description: Name to greet
          title: Name
    transition: greeter
  - id: greeter
    type: noop
    log: "Greetings jq(.name)! Welcome to Direktiv"
```

Since this schema only requires `name` when executing the workflow on the UI, the user will be prompted with a form that contains a single text input instead of the default JSON input text editor.

Below is what the form would look like for the workflow above:

<img src={RunWorkflow} alt="run-workflow" class="center" />

<div className="subheading">How it works</div>

<img
  src={ValidateForm}
  alt="validate-workflow"
  class="center"
  style={{ width: "90%" }}
/>

When the user presses the Run Button on the workflow page the `onOpen` event function will trigger on the Modal component. During this onOpen function the following things happen:

1. Validate the workflow is a valid yaml.
2. Check if the first state in the workflow is a `validate` state.
3. If the first workflow is a validate state, save its schema property to the React state `workflowJSONSchema` to be used later when generating the form. Note: The schema property in a validate state follows the same specification as a JSON schema.

After the onOpen function is complete, the Modal will open to one of two views:

1. A Editor window for the user to set instance input as JSON (`default`).
2. A Form that has been generated from the schema in the `workflowJSONSchema` state.

If `workflowJSONSchema` is set (first state is type validate), then a HTLM form will be generated and rendered using the [@rjsf/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rjsf/core) package.
