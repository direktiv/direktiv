# Validate State Form

One of the qualities of life features that the direktiv-ui adds is that when executing a workflow through the UI and the first state of that workflow is a validate state; A form will be generated to prompt users for the input.

If we take a look at the workflow below we can see that the first state is a validate state that requires the string property `name`. 

```yaml
states:
- id: validate-input
  type: validate
  schema:
    type: object
    required:
    - name
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
        description: Name to greet
        title: Name
  transition: greeter
- id: greeter
  type: noop
  log: 'Greetings jq(.name)! Welcome to Direktiv'
```

Since this schema only requires `name` when executing the workflow on the UI, the user will be prompted with a form that contains a single text input instead of the default JSON input text editor. 

Below is what the form would look like for the workflow above:

<img src={RunWorkflow} alt="run-workflow" class="center"/>


<div className="subheading">How it works</div>


<img src={ValidateForm} alt="validate-workflow" class="center" style={{width: "90%"}}/>

When the user presses the Run Button on the workflow page the `onOpen` event function will trigger on the Modal component. During this onOpen function the following things happen:
1. Validate the workflow is a valid yaml.
2. Check if the first state in the workflow is a `validate` state.
3. If the first workflow is a validate state, save its schema property to the React state `workflowJSONSchema` to be used later when generating the form. Note: The schema property in a validate state follows the same specification as a JSON schema. 

After the onOpen function is complete, the Modal will open to one of two views:
1. A Editor window for the user to set instance input as JSON (`default`).
2. A Form that has been generated from the schema in the `workflowJSONSchema` state.

If `workflowJSONSchema` is set (first state is type validate), then a HTLM form will be generated and rendered using the [@rjsf/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rjsf/core) package.
