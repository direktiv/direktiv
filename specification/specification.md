# Direktiv Workflow Definition

This document describes the rules for Direktiv workflow definition files. These files are written in YAML and dictate the behaviour of a workflow running on Direktiv. 

**Workflow**
```yaml
description: |
  A simple "Hello, world" demonstration.
states:
- id: hello
  type: noop
  transform: 'jq({ msg: "Hello, world!" })'
```

**Input**
```json
{}
```

**Output**
```json
{
	"msg": "Hello, world!"
}
```

Workflows have inputs and outputs, usually in JSON. Where examples appear in this document they will often be accompanied by inputs and outputs as seen above.

### WorkflowDefinition

This is the top-level structure of a Direktiv workflow definition. All workflows must have one.

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | Link to further information. | string | no |
| `description` | Short description of the workflow.  | string | no |
| `functions` | List of function definitions for use by function-based `states`. | [[]FunctionDefinition](#FunctionDefinition) | no |
| `start` | Configuration for how the workflow should start. | [StartDefinition](#StartDefinition) | no |
| `states` | List of all possible workflow states. | [[]StateDefinition](#StateDefinition) | yes | 
| `timeouts` | Configuration of workflow-level timeouts. | [TimeoutsDefinition](#TimeoutsDefinition) | no |

## FunctionDefinition

Functions refer to anything executable by Direktiv as a unit of logic within a subflow that isn't otherwise part of basic state functionality. Usually this means either a purpose-built container or another workflow executed as a subflow. In some cases functions can be extensively configured, and they are often reused repeatedly within a workflow. To manage the size of Direktiv workflow definitions functions are predefined as much as possible and referenced when called.

These are the currently available function types:

* [`knative-global`](#GlobalKnativeFunctionDefinition)
* [`knative-namespace`](#NamespaceKnativeFunctionDefinition)
* [`knative-workflow`](#WorkflowKnativeFunctionDefinition)
* [`subflow`](#SubflowFunctionDefinition)

The following example demonstrate how to define and reference a function within a workflow:

**Workflow**
```yaml
description: |
  A basic demonstration of functions.
functions:
- type: knative-workflow
  id: request
  image: direktiv/request:latest
  size: small
states:
- id: getter
  type: action
  action:
    function: request
    input:
      method: "GET"
      url: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1"
```

**Input**
```json
{}
```

**Output**
```json
{
  "return": {
    "userId": 1,
    "id": 1,
    "title": "delectus aut autem",
    "completed": false
  }
}
```

### GlobalKnativeFunctionDefinition

A `knative-global` refers to a function that is implemented according to the [requirements](#TODO) for a direktiv knative service. Specifically, in this case referring to a service configured to be available "globally" (to all namespaces on the Direktiv servers).

This function type supports [`files`](#FunctionFileDefinition).

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | Identifies which kind of [FunctionDefinition](#FunctionDefintion) is being used. In this case it must be set to `knative-global`. | string | yes | 
| `id` | A unique identifier for the function within the workflow definition. | string | yes |
| `service` | URI to a globally accessible function on the Direktiv servers. | string | yes |

### NamespacedKnativeFunctionDefinition

A `knative-namespace` refers to a function that is implemented according to the [requirements](#TODO) for a direktiv knative service. Specifically, in this case referring to a service configured to be available on the namespace.

This function type supports [`files`](#FunctionFileDefinition).

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | Identifies which kind of [FunctionDefinition](#FunctionDefintion) is being used. In this case it must be set to `knative-namespace`. | string | yes | 
| `id` | A unique identifier for the function within the workflow definition. | string | yes |
| `service` | URI to a function on the namespace. | string | yes |

### WorkflowKnativeFunctionDefinition

A `knative-workflow` refers to a function that is implemented according to the [requirements](#TODO) for a direktiv knative service. Specifically, in this case referring to a service that Direktiv can create on-demand for the exclusive use by this workflow.

> Historically this was called `reusable`, but this keyword has been deprecated.

This function type supports [`files`](#FunctionFileDefinition).

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | Identifies which kind of [FunctionDefinition](#FunctionDefintion) is being used. In this case it must be set to `knative-workflow`. | string | yes | 
| `id` | A unique identifier for the function within the workflow definition. | string | yes |
| `image` | URI to a `knative-workflow` compliant container. | string | yes |
| `size` | Specifies the container size. | [ContainerSizeDefinition](#ContainerSizeDefinition) | no |
| `cmd` | Custom command to execute within the container. | string | no |
| `scale` | Used as a suggestion to Direktiv for a minimum number of pods to keep running. Direktiv is not required to adhere to this minimum. The default value is zero, which may result in higher latency if a service goes unused for a while, but saves on resources. | integer | no |

#### ContainerSizeDefinition

When functions use containers you may be able to specify what size the container should be. This is done using one of three keywords, each representing a different [size preset](#TODO):

* `small`
* `medium`
* `large`

### SubflowFunctionDefinition

A `subflow` refers to a function that is actually another workflow. The other workflow is called with some input and its output is returned to this workflow.

This function type does not support [`files`](#FunctionFileDefinition).

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | Identifies which kind of [FunctionDefinition](#FunctionDefintion) is being used. In this case it must be set to `subflow`. | string | yes | 
| `id` | A unique identifier for the function within the workflow definition. | string | yes |
| `workflow` | URI to a workflow within the same namespace. | string | yes |

## StartDefinition

A `StartDefinition` may be defined using one of the following, depending on the desired behaviour:

* [`default`](#DefaultStartDefinition)
* [`scheduled`](#ScheduledStartDefinition)
* [`event`](#EventStartDefinition)
* [`eventsXor`](#EventsXorStartDefinition)
* [`eventsAnd`](#EventsAndStartDefinition)

If omitted from the workflow definition the [DefaultStartDefinition](#DefaultStartDefinition) will be used, which means the workflow will only be executed when called.

### DefaultStartDefinition

The default start definition is used for workflows that should only execute when called. This means subflows, workflows triggered by scripts, and workflows triggered manually by humans.

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | Identifies which kind of [StartDefinition](#StartDefintion) is being used. In this case it must be set to `default`. | string | yes | 
| `state` | References a defined state's `id`. This state will be used as the entrypoint into the workflow. If left undefined, it defaults to the first state defined in the `states` list.  | string | no |

### ScheduledStartDefinition

The scheduled start definition is used for workflows that should execute at regularly defined times. 

Scheduled workflow can be manually triggered for convenience and testing. They never have input data, so accurate testing should use `{}` as input. 

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | Identifies which kind of [StartDefinition](#StartDefintion) is being used. In this case it must be set to `scheduled`. | string | yes | 
| `state` | References a defined state's `id`. This state will be used as the entrypoint into the workflow. If left undefined, it defaults to the first state defined in the `states` list.  | string | no |
| `cron` | Defines the time(s) when the workflow should execute using a CRON expression. | string | yes |

**Example** (snippet)
```yaml
start:
  type: scheduled
  cron: '* * * * *' # Trigger a new instance every minute.
```

### EventStartDefinition 

The event start definition is used for workflows that should be executed whenever a relevant CloudEvents event is received.

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | Identifies which kind of [StartDefinition](#StartDefintion) is being used. In this case it must be set to `eventsXor`. | string | yes | 
| `state` | References a defined state's `id`. This state will be used as the entrypoint into the workflow. If left undefined, it defaults to the first state defined in the `states` list.  | string | no |
| `events` | Defines what events can trigger the workflow.  | [[]StartEventDefinition](#StartEventDefinition) | yes |

### EventsAndStartDefinition 

The event "and" start definition is used for workflows that should be executed when multiple matching CloudEvents events are received.

| `lifespan` | An ISO8601 duration string. Sets the maximum duration an event can be stored before being discarded while waiting for other events. | string | no |
| `correlate` | CloudEvents event context keys can must exist on every event and have matching values to be grouped together. | []string | no |
| `events` | Defines what events can trigger the workflow.  | [[]StartEventDefinition](#StartEventDefinition) | yes |

### StartEventDefinition

The StartEventDefinition is a structure shared by various start definitions involving events. 

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | Identifies which CloudEvents events can trigger the workflow by requiring an exact match to the event's own `type` context value. | string | yes | 
| `filters` | Optional key-value pairs to further restrict what events can trigger the workflow. For each pair, incoming CloudEvents context values will be checked for a match. All pairs must find a match for the event to be accepted. The "keys" are strings that match exactly to specific context keys, but the "values" can be "glob" patterns allowing them to match a range of possible context values. | object | no |

The input data of an event-triggered workflow is a JSON representation of all the received events stored under keys matching the events' respective type. For example, this CloudEvents event will result in the following input data in a workflow triggered by a single event:

**CloudEvents Event**
```json
{
    "specversion" : "1.0",
    "type" : "com.github.pull.create",
    "source" : "https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/pull",
    "subject" : "123",
    "id" : "A234-1234-1234",
    "time" : "2018-04-05T17:31:00Z",
    "comexampleextension1" : "value",
    "comexampleothervalue" : 5,
    "datacontenttype" : "text/xml",
    "data" : "<much wow=\"xml\"/>"
}
```

		"comexampleothervalue" : 5,
		"datacontenttype" : "text/xml",
		"data" : "<much wow=\"xml\"/>"
	}
}
```

The "keys" must be strings that match exactly to specific context keys, but the "values" can be "glob" patterns allowing them to match a range of possible context values. | [Structured JQ](#StructuredJQ) | no |

The received data of an event-triggered workflow is a JSON representation of all the received events stored under keys matching the events' respective type. For example, this CloudEvents event will result in the following data:

**CloudEvents Event**

### NoopStateDefinition

Often workflows need to do something that can be achieved using logic built into most state types. For example, to log something, or to transform the instance data by running a `jq` command. In many cases this can be done by an existing state within the workflow, but sometimes it's necessary to split it out into a separate state. The `noop` state exists for this purpose.

Two specific MIME types cause this state to behave differently: `text/plain` and `application/octet-stream`. If the `value` evaluates to a JSON string the MIME type is `text/plain`, that string will be stored in plaintext (without JSON quotes and escapes). If if the `value` is a JSON string containing base64 encoded data and the MIME type is `application/octet-stream`, the base64 data will be decoded and stored as binary data. | string | no |
| `value` | Select or generate the data to store.  | [Structured JQ](#StructuredJQ) | yes |

### SwitchStateDefinition

To change the behaviour of a workflow based on the instance data, use a `switch` state. This state does nothing except choose between any number of different possible state transitions.

| `conditions` | List of conditions, which are evaluated in-order until a match is found. | [[]SwitchConditionDefinition](#SwitchConditionDefinition) | yes |

### SwitchConditionDefinition 

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required |

| `transition` | Identifies which state to transition to next, referring to the next state's unique `id`. If undefined, matching this condition terminates the workflow. | string | no | 

### ValidateStateDefinition

Since workflows receive external input it may be necessary to check that instance data is valid. The `validate` state exists for this purpose. 

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | Identifies which kind of [StateDefinition](#StateDefinition) is being used. In this case it must be set to `validate`. | string | yes |

| `schema` | A YAMLified representation of a JSON Schema that defines whether the `subject` is considered valid. | object | yes |

### TimeoutsDefinition

In addition to any timeouts applied on a state-by-state basis, every workflow has two global timeouts that begin ticking from the moment the workflow starts. This is where you can configure these timeouts differently to their defaults.

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `interrupt` | An ISO8601 duration string. Sets the time to wait before throwing a catchable `direktiv.cancels.timeout.soft` error. Consider this a soft timeout. | string | no |
| `kill` | An ISO8601 duration string. Sets the time to wait before throwing an uncatchable `direktiv.cancels.timeout.hard` error. This is a hard timeout. | string | no |

### StructuredJQ

To make Direktiv powerful and flexible we use `jq` in many places. Wherever a type called Structured JQ appears you can input generic data in any form you like, and it will be converted from YAML to JSON. For example, this log field will output the following JSON:

**YAML**
```yaml
log: 
  a: 5
```

**JSON**
```json
{
  "a": 5
}
```

Structured JQ also inspects all strings in the YAML searching for embedded queries, executing them and inserting the results into the data. Embeddeed queries are wrapped within the brackets of `jq()`, as in the following example:

**Instance Data**
```json
{
  "x": 5
}
```

**YAML**
```yaml
log: 
  a: 'jq(.x)'
```

**JSON**
```json
{
  "a": 5
}
```

If the JQ brackets the entire string the entire field will be replaced with the results of the query, as in the above example where `a` is represented as a JSON integer. Otherwise the results will be marshalled into JSON and be inserted as a string into the parent string. 

**Instance Data**
```json
{
  "x": 5
}
```

**YAML**
```yaml
log: 
  a: 'x = jq(.x)'
```

**JSON**
```json
{
  "a": "x = 5"
}
```

These JQ substitutions are not limited to primitive types. Entire objects or arrays, or anything else is all supported. 

**Instance Data**
```json
{
  "x": 5
}
```

**YAML**
```yaml
log: 'jq(.)'
```

**JSON**
```json
{
  "x": 5
}
```

### StateErrorCatchers

TODO

### StateLogging

The most common type to use is a string, which may contain structured `jq`, but any types are valid since the generated logs are JSON.

TODO 

### InstanceMetadata 

The workflow will replace the instance's metadata with the provided value. Can be any type, and supports structured `jq`.

TODO 

### StateTransforms

The workflow will modify its memory just before it completes the state. The evaluated result of the transform must be an object.

TODO 

### Variables

Most workflows can get by with their instance data, but in some cases that may be insufficient. Instance data has a limited maximum size, and on its own it cannot be used to persist data long-term. Variables are stored on Direktiv as a means of storing and retrieving data between functions, instances, or workflows. 

All variables belong to a `scope`. The scopes are `instance`, `workflow`, and `namespace`. Instance scoped variables are only accessible to the singular instance that created them. Workflow scoped variables can be used and shared between multiple instances of the same workflow. Namespace scoped variables are available to all instances of all workflows on the namespace. 

All variables are identified by a name, and each name is unique within its scope. The main ways for workflows to interact with variables is through [`getter`](#GetterStateDefinition) and [`setter`](#SetterStateDefinition) states, though other methods are also possible. 

In addition to the scopes outlined above, there is a special `system` scope. This scope is a utility to make miscellaneous information accessible to an instance. The following special variables exist in the system scope:

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `instance` | Returns the instance ID of the running instance. |
| `uuid` | Returns a randomly generated UUID. |
| `epoch` | Returns the current time in unix/epoch format. |
