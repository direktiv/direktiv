# Noop State 

```yaml
- id: a
  type: noop
```

## NoopStateDefinition

Often workflows need to do something that can be achieved using logic built into most state types. For example, to log something, or to transform the instance data by running a `jq` command. In many cases this can be done by an existing state within the workflow, but sometimes it's necessary to split it out into a separate state. The `noop` state exists for this purpose.

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | Identifies which kind of [StateDefinition](./states.md) is being used. In this case it must be set to `noop`. | string | yes | 
| `id` | An identifier unique within the workflow to this one state. | string | yes |
| `log` | If defined, the workflow will generate a log when it commences this state. See [StateLogging](./logging.md). | [Structured JQ](../instance-data/structured-jx.md) | no |
| `metadata` | If defined, updates the instance's metadata. See [InstanceMetadata](./metadata.md). | [Structured JQ](../instance-data/structured-jx.md) | no |
| `transform` | If defined, modifies the instance's data upon completing the state logic. See [StateTransforms](../instance-data/transforms.md). | [Structured JQ](../instance-data/structured-jx.md) | no |
| `transition` | Identifies which state to transition to next, referring to the next state's unique `id`. If undefined, this state terminates the workflow. | string | no |
| `catch` | Defines behaviour for handling of catchable errors.  | [[]ErrorCatchDefinition](./errors.md) | no |
