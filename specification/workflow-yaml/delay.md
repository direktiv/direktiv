# Delay State

```yaml
- id: a
  type: delay
  duration: PT10S
```

## DelayStateDefinition

If the workflow needs to pause for a specific length of time, the delay state is usually the simplest way to do that.

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | Identifies which kind of [StateDefinition](./states.md) is being used. In this case it must be set to `delay`. | string | yes | 
| `id` | An identifier unique within the workflow to this one state. | string | yes |

| `metadata` | If defined, updates the instance's metadata. See [InstanceMetadata](./metadata.md). | [Structured JQ](../instance-data/structured-jx.md) | no |
| `transform` | If defined, modifies the instance's data upon completing the state logic. See [StateTransforms](../instance-data/transforms.md). | [Structured JQ](../instance-data/structured-jx.md) | no |
| `transition` | Identifies which state to transition to next, referring to the next state's unique `id`. If undefined, this state terminates the workflow. | string | no |
