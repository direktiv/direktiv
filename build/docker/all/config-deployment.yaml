  # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
  #
  # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
  # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
  # to actually change the configuration.

  # The freezer service endpoint that queue-proxy calls when its traffic drops to zero or
  # scales up from zero.
  #
  # Freezer service is available at: https://github.com/knative-sandbox/container-freezer
  # or users may write their own service.
  #
  # The value will need to include both the host and the port that will be accessed.
  # For the host, $HOST_IP can be passed, and the appropriate host IP value will be swapped
  # in at runtime, which will enable the freezer daemonset to be reachable via the node IP.
  #
  # As an example:
  #     concurrency-state-endpoint: "http://$HOST_IP:9696"
  #
  # If not set, queue proxy takes no action (this is the default behavior).
  #
  # When enabled, a serviceAccountToken will be mounted to queue-proxy using
  # a projected volume. This requires the Service Account Token Volume Projection feature
  # to be enabled. For details, see this link:
  # https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#service-account-token-volume-projection
  #
  # NOTE THAT THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL / ALPHA FEATURE
