     * This function returns a an object with a the following properties:
     *
     * dispatch: an async function to dispatch the sse request. It will return
     * a promise that resolves when the first message or error is received
     *
     *
     * onMessageMock: a jest mock function that will be called when a message
     * is received. The mock function will be called with the JSON parsed message
     *
     * onErrorMock: a jest mock function that will be called when an error is
     * received
     *
     * CURRENT LIMITATION:
     * this sse will only call the mock function when the first message or error is
     * received this can be changed in the future if needed. The general problem is,
     * that we don't want to block the jest process very long. We might add some
     * parameter to the direktivSSE configures how many messages we want to receive
     * before we close the connection again. We might also do something in between
     * two messages. We can extend this feature when we have the first very specific
     * use case.
